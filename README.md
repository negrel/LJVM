# `LJVM` - LuaJIT Virtual Machine

`LJVM` (LuaJIT Virtual Machine) is a bytecode interpreter and JIT compiler
forked from [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org).

## Why ?

LuaJIT is a pure product of craftsmanship built and improved over the years.
Today still, LuaJIT is one of the fastest JIT compiler available. However, only
Lua benefits from it. This library exists to enable more programming language
to take advantages of LuaJIT strength:
* Portable: runs on Windows, Linux, BSD, macOS, Android, iOS, PS3, PS4, PS5, PS Vita,
Xbox 360, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch
* Fast: optimize performance by compiling bytecode to native code at runtime
* Built-in garbage collection
